Scripts to prepare the raspberry pi for RaspAP
==============================================

'create_RAM_version.sh' : modify the system services and file system in order to minimize the write access to the sd-card.

'install_wlan.sh' : Install the drivers for commonly used Realtek wireless adapters. The sources are extracted from github repositories, compiled and installed. Depending on the raspberry pi version, this can take a long time.
